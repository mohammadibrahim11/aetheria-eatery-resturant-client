    "description": "One of Thailand’s most common curry varieties, red curries are a happy medium: generally spicier than yellow curries but less so than the green varieties. The distinctive red color of this rich, sweet and aromatic curry comes from crushed red chilies in the curry paste (a base of garlic, shallots, blue ginger and lemongrass), which is added to coconut milk, vegetables, such as eggplant, mushrooms, or tomatoes and chicken breast slices. The curry is topped off with finely sliced kaffir leaves and sweet basil, presenting a perfectly balanced combo of creamy and spicy broth to get those tastebuds tingling.One of the best-known red curry varieties, Massaman Chicken Curry, is mild, sweet and simmered in coconut milk; however, is unusual for its less soupy consistency and interpretation of a traditional Persian dish and Indian curry, made with roasted spices."
